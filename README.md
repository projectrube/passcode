# Passcode

This rube module contains all you need a simple [Go](https://golang.org) based keyboard entry program. When running, it simply listens to all keyboard input awaiting for a preset keystroke combination (e.g. "12345"). Upon entry a http request is made to the Node-RED back-end that can trigger an action of your choice.
